- Welcome. This folder contains some examples of my RSelenium/Rvest codes for web scraping; I am only an entry-level user of R, so this might be too simple for you, and it might contain some rookie mistakes. So please feel free to advise me if you have a better idea somewhere. 

- Sincerely, thanks!
